# Summary
Random Clock is a widget that will randomly show one of the installed watch faces each time the LCD is turned on.

# How it works
Everytime the LCD is turned off, the widget randomly changes the clock. When you long press BTN 3 the next time,
you might (or might not, it's random after all) see another watch face.
